# Monopoly-clone research index

Eight research files, ~5,000 lines, produced 2026-08-20 by parallel research agents plus one live
browser capture of richup.io.

**Read this page before any of them.** It is a reconciliation table, not a table of contents. The files
were written independently and they contradict each other in a few specific places. Those places are
listed below with a ruling. If you skip this page and read `board-data.md` first, you will seed your
database from Hasbro's rent table — which is the single most likely way to get this project wrong.

## Project decisions (from the user, 2026-08-20)

These are settled and override anything in the research files that assumes otherwise:

1. **No monetization.** No coins, no store, no paid maps, no ads. richup's paywall is described in these
   files only as an observation about richup — it is not a feature to reproduce.
2. **Share-link rooms are the whole distribution model.** Create a room, get a
   `yourapp/<room-code>` URL, send it to friends, they join and play. No accounts required.
   `richup-ux-and-flow.md` §1 documents richup's version of exactly this flow.
3. **All four board maps ship, free, with identical rules.** Complete verified data for all four is in
   `richup-maps-all.md`. Note the maps are *not* interchangeable reskins — see the warning below.
4. Consequently the "2–6 free, 7–8 paid" player cap (conflict #4 below) is moot: pick one ceiling.
5. **Zero cost is a hard constraint.** The project must run entirely on free tiers — no paid hosting, no
   card on file, no plan that can bill by surprise. This constrains the stack, not the features.
6. **All four maps ship, including richup's three paid ones.** Data for all four is captured and free to use.
7. **v1 scope = playable core:** rooms + share link, roll/move/buy/rent, houses + hotels, jail, bankruptcy,
   win. Auctions, mortgage, double-rent, trades, bots, teams, and the turn clock are all v2 — which matches
   richup's own defaults (auction/mortgage/double-rent ship OFF there too).
   v1 *plays* Classic; the engine must be map-driven from commit 1 so the other three are a data flip.

> **Building all four maps is a bigger architectural commitment than it looks.** Mr. Worldwide is a
> **48-tile board**, not 40. Lucky Wheel has **no utilities at all** and a tile type (`tax-refund`) that
> exists on no other map. Death Valley has **six-property colour groups**. If you hardcode 40 tiles,
> `boardIndex % 40`, three-property groups, or exactly two utilities anywhere, all three premium maps break.
> Board size, group size, utility count, and the tile-type set must all be map data from the first commit.
> So must **building supply** — Hasbro's 32 houses/12 hotels is tuned to 22 properties in groups of 2–3,
> and Death Valley's six-property groups break it.
>
> **And the card decks are not captured for any map.** richup's decks are per-map ("tiles, properties
> *and stacks*") and entirely server-side; the premium ones sit behind the paywall. Lucky Wheel resolves
> **40% of its landings** through a deck nobody has seen. You will be writing your own decks — which
> `richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` §4 says you should be doing anyway, for IP reasons.

## The one rule

> **`richup-maps-all.md` is the authority for all board data** (all four maps, every tile and rent),
> and its schema is canonical. `richup-observed-live.md` §9 repeats the Classic board in an earlier
> schema — the two were machine-diffed and every tile matches, so §9 is kept for narrative context only.
> **`richup-observed-live.md` is the authority for every other richup.io fact** — settings, terminology,
> tech stack, monetization.
> It is the only file whose data came from richup's own running client — a private room was created,
> the game joined, and the React props of all 40 board tiles read directly. Everything else about
> richup in this set came from bundle-grepping, userscripts, screenshots, or search, and defers to it.

For **official Hasbro rules**, the authority is `rules-official.md` (four rulebook PDFs, text extracted,
board tiles verified by rendering the PDF pages) with `rules-edge-cases.md` for anything adversarial.

## Conflicts, and how they resolve

### 1. Does richup use the standard board's prices and rents? **No.**
`board-data.md` originally concluded "prices appear to match the standard board (LIKELY)" from two
legible price tags in a screenshot. **That was wrong and has been corrected in place.** The live capture
shows richup re-tuned every colour group:

- **Prices:** richup makes prices strictly ascending inside each group where Hasbro repeats one —
  Italy 130/140/160, Germany 180/190/200, China 210/220/240, France 260/270/280, UK 290/300/320,
  USA 360/400. Only Brazil (60/60) keeps a repeated price; even Israel differs — 100/**110**/120 vs
  Hasbro's 100/100/120.
- **Rents:** re-tuned in both directions across every group. Only Boardwalk's ladder
  (New York, 50/200/600/1400/1700/2000) survives unchanged.
- **Tile order:** Surprise sits at index **8** (not 7) and Water Company at index **27** (not 28).
  `board-data.md` found these independently from the board render — the two agree.

→ **Use `richup-observed-live.md` §9.** `board-data.md` remains correct and useful for the *standard*
Hasbro board; just don't read its numbers as richup's.

### 2. Does richup have a turn timer? **Yes, and no.**
`richup-rules-and-settings.md` proves from richup's `.strict()` Zod schema that **no turn-timer room
setting exists**. `richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` and `richup-ux-and-flow.md` document a **Turn Clock**
(chess-style, refilling, shipped v1.17 on 15 Aug 2026, with an ask-opponents-for-more-time mechanic).
Both are right: the clock is **hardcoded server-side behaviour, not a configurable option**. The live
settings panel confirms it — no timer control appears anywhere in it.

### 3. What are richup's setting defaults?
`richup-rules-and-settings.md` read them from the client's fallback default object and flagged them
UNVERIFIED. The live capture read them off the actual rendered controls. **They agree**, so treat these
as confirmed for a freshly created private room:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| `x2 rent on full-set properties` | **OFF** |
| `Auction` | **OFF** |
| `Mortgage` | **OFF** |
| `Vacation cash` | OFF |
| `Don't collect rent while in prison` | OFF |
| `Even build` | **ON** |
| `Randomize player order` | **ON** |
| `Starting cash` | **$1500** (options 500–3000) |
| `Maximum players` | 4 |

> The headline: **three rules that are mandatory in official Monopoly ship OFF by default** — no monopoly
> rent doubling, no auctions, no mortgaging. A default richup game is deliberately a simpler, faster game.
> Model all three as first-class config flags from day one.

### 4. Max players: 2–8 or 2–6? **Both — 7 and 8 are paid.**
Resolved across three sources. The live Classic-map dropdown offers **2 through 8**, so
`richup-observed-live.md` §2 records the full range. But `richup-ux-and-flow.md` found the cap is
**2–6 free, with 7–8 a paid store upgrade**, and `richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` independently found a
per-map extension unlocking 7–8. The options render for everyone; entitlement is checked elsewhere.
Not confirmed by clicking (7/8 was never selected during the live capture).
→ Make the ceiling data, not a constant, and keep the entitlement check server-side.

### 5. richup's house-rule toggles
`house-rules-common.md` §4's "richup column" is explicitly self-flagged as guesswork.
→ **Superseded** by `richup-rules-and-settings.md` §A and `richup-observed-live.md` §2. The rest of that
file (the catalogue, the balance analysis, the landing probabilities) stands on its own.

### 6. Tax amounts differ three ways
Hasbro classic: Income Tax **$200 or 10%**, Luxury Tax **$75**. Hasbro 2021 Game Guide: Income Tax flat
**$200** (the 10% option was dropped), Luxury Tax **$100**. richup: "Earnings Tax" **10% of net worth**,
"Premium Tax" flat **$75**. Pick one deliberately; don't average them.

## What nobody could verify — real gaps, not oversights

These are server-side in richup and were confirmed absent from both shipped bundles by direct grep:

1. **START salary** (the pass-GO amount) — no `passStart` / `startBonus` / `goMoney` identifier exists.
2. **Prison release fee** — no `prisonFee` / `payToLeave` identifier exists.
3. **Company (utility) rent multipliers** — utilities carry no rent array at all in client state, only
   `price: 150`. Hasbro's 4×/10× is the obvious guess but is *not* confirmed for richup.
4. **Surprise / Treasure card text and count** — entirely server-side. Three independent lanes confirmed
   this. What *is* known: the decks are named `treasure` and `surprise`, deck state is
   `{pardonCardHolderId, currentIndex}` (so **one Pardon card per deck**, fixed-order rotating index),
   and decks are per-map.
5. **Turn clock durations** in seconds.

Recommended handling for #4: ship the official *effects* from `cards.md` with your own original flavour
text. Copying Hasbro's card wording is one of the specific things `richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` §4 says
not to do, and richup itself doesn't.

## Before you write code

1. **`rules-edge-cases.md` §7** — 30 numbered decisions, each with a recommended default and the state
   or event it implies. Work through it and record your answers; it is effectively the spec.
2. **Build server-authoritative.** richup's board, rules, and state all live on the server and stream to
   a thin client. A public "cheat suite" with a socket interceptor and auto-play bot exists for richup
   (`richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` §5), so **treat the client as hostile from day one** — never send a
   player state they shouldn't see, and never trust the client for dice, money, or ownership.
3. **Make the board data, not code.** `prisonBlockIndex` is per-map in richup; so are the card decks and
   the player-count ceiling. Four maps exist (Classic free; Mr. Worldwide, Death Valley, Lucky Wheel paid).
4. **Do not copy:** the word "Monopoly" in your product name or domain, Hasbro's property names, its exact
   card text, or its board artwork. Game *mechanics* are not protectable; the specific expression is.
   `richup-vs-monopoly-diff.md` §4 has the detail — it is a factual summary, not legal advice, and a
   lawyer should review before any public launch.
5. **Tags in every file:** `[OFFICIAL]` = Hasbro, `[RICHUP-DEFAULT]` = richup out of the box,
   `[RICHUP-TOGGLE]` = a richup option, `[HOUSE-RULE]` = popular but unofficial. Every rule statement
   carries one. Don't let them blur when you implement — that mush is what this tagging exists to prevent.
