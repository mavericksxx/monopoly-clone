/**
 * Thin adapter over the engine lane's pinned module API (SPEC.md "Module API"):
 *
 *   createGame(map, players, settings, rng): GameState
 *   reduce(map, state, pa, rng): { state, events }
 *
 * The local `CreateGameFn`/`ReduceFn` types re-impose the pinned signatures, so the rest
 * of this lane is typed against the contract rather than against the engine's internals.
 *
 * `reduce` reports an illegal or out-of-turn action by RETURNING `error` — it never throws,
 * and on error it returns the same `state` reference with no events. Callers must check
 * `error` explicitly; a try/catch alone would silently accept every rejected action.
