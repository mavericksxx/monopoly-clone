/**
 * Everything that happens once a token comes to rest on a tile: buy prompts,
 * rent, tax, and card effects. Card effects that move the player (move_to,
 * move_relative, move_to_nearest) recurse back into resolveLanding, since
 * landing on the new tile must resolve exactly like any other landing.
 *
 * Every branch here leaves `state.phase` fully decided by the time it
 * returns: AWAITING_BUY when a buy prompt is owed, whatever RESOLVING_DEBT /
 * GAME_OVER openDebt/settleBankruptcy produced, or phaseAfterLanding() when
 * nothing is left pending. Callers (reducer.ts) never need to second-guess it.
